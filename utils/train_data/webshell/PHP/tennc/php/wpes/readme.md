# &#128026; WeakNet PHP Execution Shell
This is a simple <b>Post-exploitation PHP Exec Shell</b> that I wish to expand upon. It is only text, no images, or pulled scripts, etc. Just one single file. I have added support for traversing directories that are listed by <code>ls</code> commands and even <code>cat</code> for files listed. This shell comes with WEAKERTHAN Linux 6+<br />
