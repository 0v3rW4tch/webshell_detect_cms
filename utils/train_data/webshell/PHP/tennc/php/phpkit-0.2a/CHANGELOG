0.1a - 07/01 (Jan)/2013 - Initial Commit
0.1b - 08/01 (Jan)/2013 - Major Upgrade. Now tests for system(), shell_exec() and passthru()
                          Uses simple logic to choose the first one that works.
                          Needs code cleanup soon, and implementation of exec() :)
0.2a - 17/01 (Jan)/2013 - Realized I was still thinking it was January. Updated the client a bit.
                          Preparing for the 0.2a release by finishing the upload client and writing
                          documentation for it. Code is a lot cleaner now though. Still need to fix
                          the bloody "test" function :/
